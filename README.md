How to Customize
This portfolio is built within a single index.html file, making it very easy to customize. To add your own information, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)

Open index.html: Open the index.html file in your favorite code editor.

Edit the Content: Look for the comments that mark each section (e.g., <!-- About Me Section -->, <!-- Projects Section -->). You can replace the placeholder text and image URLs within these sections with your own content.

Text: Simply change the text inside the HTML tags (like <p>, <h1>, <h3>).

Images: Replace the src attribute in the <img> tags. I've used placehold.co for placeholders, which you can replace with your own images.

Links: Update the href attribute in the <a> tags for your social media profiles, project demos, and GitHub links.

Deploy to GitHub Pages: After customizing, commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository. Then, you can easily deploy it as a live website using GitHub Pages from the repository's settings.
